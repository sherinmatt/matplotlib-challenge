# Objectives and Steps Taken
* Analyze the mice study data and the impact of the pharmaceutical drugs
* Analyze these datas and find important correlations
* Analyze the consequences of using the Capomulin drug
* Throught this work, I created a bargraph , piechart scatterplot etc to analyze the different variables

# Observations and Insights
* Interestingly, when we look at the pie plot, it shows that there is mostly an equal male and female mice distribution
* Also, looking at the Average tumor volume vs. Mouse weight in Capomulin regimine scatterplot, we can see that as the weight of the mouse increases, the tumor also increases
* Furthermore, the scatterplot also show the correlation between increasing mouse weight and tumor volume for mice in capomulin 
* And the scatterplot has an ascending regression line thereby delineating a positive correlation between the variables.
