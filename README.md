# matplotlib-challenge: linear regression model

   ## Background/Objectives
      * Analyze the performance of the Capomulin pharmaceutical drug vs other drugs in this mice study data. The goal is to utilize statistical modeling (linear regression) to analyze the impact of 4 different anti-cancer pharmaceutical drugs. 
      * Analyze the data provided and find important correlations between the variables
      * Analyze the consequences of using the Capomulin drug as opposed to other drugs

   ## Technologies used:
      * Pandas
      * Matplotlib
      * NumPy
      * Scipy

   ## Data:
      * Mouse_metadata.csv
      * Study_results.csv

   ## Steps Taken:
    * Firstly, I created a summary table that shows the mean,median, standard deviation and SEM of the tumor volume in the study.
    * In this work, I also created barcharts using Panda and Matplotlib to display the number of mice that went through drug treatments.
    * Created pieplots using Panda and Matplotlib to display the male vs female ratio.
    * Created boxplots to display the total tumor volume and the treatment regimes.
    * Developed a scatterplot to show the relation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
    * Lastly, created a linear regression model graph to show correlation.

   ## Observations and Insights:
    * Interestingly, when we look at the pie plot, it shows that there is mostly an equal male and female mice distribution.
    * Also, looking at the average tumor volume vs. Mouse weight in Capomulin regimine scatterplot, we can see that as the weight of the mouse increases, the tumor   volume also increases.
    * Furthermore, the scatterplot also show the correlation between increasing mouse weight and tumor volume for mice in capomulin. And the scatterplot has an ascending regression line thereby delineating a positive correlation between the variables.
    * Overall, the Capomulin drug had strong effects on the mices tumor volume.
