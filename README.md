# matplotlib-challenge: Objectives
* Analyze the performance of the Capomulin pharmaceutical drug vs other drugs in this mice study data
* Analyze the data provided and find important correlations between the variables
* Analyze the consequences of using the Capomulin drug

# Steps Taken:
* Firstly, I created a summary table that shows the mean,median, standard deviation and SEM of the tumor volume in the study.
* In this work, I also created barcharts using Panda and Matplotlib to display the number of mice that went through drug treatments.
* I created pieplots using Panda and Matplotlib to display the male vs female ratio.
* I created boxplots to display the total tumor volume and the treatment regimes.
* I created a scatterplot to show the relation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
* Lastly, I created a linear regression model graph to show correlation.

# Observations and Insights:
* Interestingly, when we look at the pie plot, it shows that there is mostly an equal male and female mice distribution.
* Also, looking at the average tumor volume vs. Mouse weight in Capomulin regimine scatterplot, we can see that as the weight of the mouse increases, the tumor volume also increases.
* Furthermore, the scatterplot also show the correlation between increasing mouse weight and tumor volume for mice in capomulin. And the scatterplot has an ascending regression line thereby delineating a positive correlation between the variables.
* Overall, the Capomulin drug had strong effects on the mices tumor volume.
